# QuickPose
Gesture Drawing Photo/Timer App

simple application made for the purpose of displaying images for artists to copy.


Just needs python, with pillow, pygame, and screeninfo installed.
- install with "pip install -r requirements.txt"


Pulls images from a user-selected folder, moves them to a "used" directory when completed.
The image viewer has options for pausing, skipping, and going back.
The user can choose the length of the timer, and how many images are displayed.
Has a bonus "autoruns" section so you can start programs, like a music player or your template for your art program, a work timer, or whatever else, all from hitting the start button.

Not much of a programmer, so if someone more skilled wants to contribute, then by all means!
